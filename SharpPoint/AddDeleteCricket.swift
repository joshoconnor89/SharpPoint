//This class controls the button at the top right of cricket games which is a + or -, depending on state.  If it is a + initially, and is pressed, it turns on -, and vice versa.  Basically this controls whether the image is added or deleted when the cell is tapped.  When the button is a +, the cell will populate an image when tapped.  When the button is a -, the cell will delete the last added image.
